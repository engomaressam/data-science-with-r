You have been hired by a US Venture Capital firm as a data scientist. The company is considering foreign grain markets to help meet supply chain requirements and it will be up to you to provide a high level analysis of crop production in Canada.

You will be required to answer questions similar to what a real life data analyst or data scientist would be tasked, and you will be assessed both on the correctness of your SQL queries and results.

A jupyter notebook is provided to help you complete this assignment. Follow the instructions to complete all of the problems, then share the Queries and Results with your peers to review.

There are a total of 25 points possible for this final project.

Below is the breakdown of possible points:

Problem 1:  2 points

Problem 2:  2 points

Problem 3:  1 point

Problem 4:  1 point

Problem 5:  1 point

Problem 6:  1 point

Problem 7:  2 points

Problem 8:  2points

Problem 9:  2 points 

Problem 10: 2 points

Problem 11: 3 points

Problem 12: 3 points

Problem 13: 3 points
