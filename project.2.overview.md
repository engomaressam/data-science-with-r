Overview and Scenario
OVERVIEW 
Now that you have been equipped with the knowledge and skills to process and analyze data with R, you will have the opportunity in this final project to practice and apply it by analyzing real-world weather data. 

FINAL PROJECT SCENARIO 
In this scenario, you will play the role of a data scientist who was recently hired by a US Weather forecast firm. The company is considering the weather condition to help predict the possibility of precipitations, which involves using various local climatological variables, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, dew point, and pressure. The data you will be handling was collected by an NOAA weather station located at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York. 

Your task is to provide a high-level analysis of weather data in JFK Airport. Your stakeholders want to understand the current and historical record of precipitations based on different variables. 

Your team has been using IBM Watson Studio, which is a powerful and easy-to-use platform for data analysis and data science tasks. As a new team member, your team leader has assigned this task to you. You need to leverage your R skills to acquire the relevant datasets, as well as process and analyze them using Watson Studio. 

WATSON STUDIO 
For this project, you will use Watson Studio. Watson Studio is a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy your projects.  

INSTRUCTIONAL LABS 
To help you finish the final project, we have prepared several instructional labs: 

Create IBM Cloud account and Watson Studio instance 

Download a skeleton Jupyter notebook with tasks, sample code, and comments 

Add the skeleton Jupyter notebook to Watson Studio 

Analyze NOAA Weather Sample Data of JFK Airport (New York) 

Share your Jupyter notebook via Watson Studio for peer-review ,
