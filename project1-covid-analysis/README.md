# Project 1 — COVID-19 Analysis (R)

A reproducible pipeline that web-scrapes, cleans, and analyzes COVID-19 data, exploring patterns, ratios, and country-level comparisons.

## Key Artifacts
- `covid19_analysis.R` — end-to-end R script
- `final_jupyter_covid19.ipynb` — notebook version
- `COVID19_Analysis_Summary.md` — narrative summary
- `screenshots/` — selected visuals of major tasks

## How to Run
- R script: `Rscript project1-covid-analysis/covid19_analysis.R`
- Notebook: open `final_jupyter_covid19.ipynb` (includes code and outputs)

## Highlights
- Web scraping and dataset assembly
- Cleaning, feature creation, and ratio analysis (e.g., cases per population)
- Sorting, filtering, and comparative visualization

## Example Visuals
- `screenshots/task4_global_stats.png` — global statistics view
- `screenshots/task6_sorting.png` — sorted comparisons across regions

## Tech Stack
- R (tidyverse)
- Python notebook for documentation (optional)
