# COVID-19 Data Analysis Screenshots - Version 2

## 🔧 Fixes Applied Based on AI Grading Feedback

This version addresses all the issues identified in the AI grading feedback to ensure full compliance with the assignment requirements.

### 🎨 Visual Improvements
- **White Background**: Changed from dark terminal theme to white background for better AI readability
- **High Contrast Text**: Used dark text on light background for optimal visibility
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, academic-style presentation

### 📋 Content Corrections

#### ✅ Task 1: Web Scraping (CORRECT - No changes needed)
- Shows completed `get_wiki_covid19_page` function
- Demonstrates HTTP response from COVID-19 Wikipedia page

#### ✅ Task 2: Data Preprocessing (CORRECT - No changes needed)  
- Shows HTML table extraction from Wikipedia page
- Demonstrates conversion to data frame

#### ✅ Task 3: Data Export (CORRECT - No changes needed)
- Shows data preprocessing and CSV export
- Demonstrates summary before and after processing

#### 🔧 Task 4: Data Subsetting (FIXED)
- **Previous Issue**: Showed global statistics calculation
- **Fix Applied**: Now shows proper data subsetting (5th-10th rows with 'country' and 'confirmed' columns)
- **Compliance**: Meets rubric requirement for reading CSV and getting target subset

#### 🔧 Task 5: Confirmation Ratio (FIXED)
- **Previous Issue**: Showed individual country confirmed-to-population ratios
- **Fix Applied**: Now calculates worldwide confirmation ratio (confirmed cases / tested cases)
- **Compliance**: Shows sums of confirmed and tested cases, then calculates ratio

#### 🔧 Task 6: Country Sorting (FIXED)
- **Previous Issue**: Sorted countries by confirmed cases (descending)
- **Fix Applied**: Now sorts country names alphabetically
- **Compliance**: Shows character type check and alphabetical sorting

#### ✅ Task 7: Pattern Matching (CORRECT - No changes needed)
- Shows regex pattern matching for countries with "United"
- Demonstrates filtered data frame output

#### 🔧 Task 8: Country Comparison (FIXED)
- **Previous Issue**: Showed general comparison between Brazil and Russia
- **Fix Applied**: Now shows specific columns (country, confirmed, confirmed.population.ratio)
- **Compliance**: Demonstrates selection of two countries and three target columns

#### ✅ Task 9: Ratio Comparison (CORRECT - No changes needed)
- Shows IF statement comparing confirmed-to-population ratios
- Demonstrates printing country with larger ratio

#### ✅ Task 10: Threshold Filtering (CORRECT - No changes needed)
- Shows filtering countries with ratio < 1%
- Demonstrates threshold-based data selection

## 📊 Expected Grading Improvement

Based on the AI grading rubric, these fixes should address all identified issues:

- **Visual Clarity**: White background should resolve readability issues
- **Task 4**: Now shows proper data subsetting instead of global stats
- **Task 5**: Now calculates worldwide confirmation ratio instead of individual ratios  
- **Task 6**: Now sorts country names alphabetically instead of by cases
- **Task 8**: Now shows required columns instead of general comparison
