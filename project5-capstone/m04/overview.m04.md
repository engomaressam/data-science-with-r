Predict Bike-Sharing Demand Using Regression Models
Now that you have performed exploratory and visual analysis on the bike sharing demand datasets and obtained some preliminary insights on the attributes, itâ€™s time to build, evaluate, and refine several predictive models and find the best performing model for predicting hourly bike rent count.

We will help your model building and evaluation process via the following instructional labs:

LAB: Predict Hourly Rented Bike Count using Basic Linear Regression Models (90 mins):

TASK: Split data into training and testing datasets
TASK: Build a linear regression model using only the weather variables
TASK: Build a linear regression model using both weather and date/time variables
TASK: Evaluate the models and identify important variables
LAB: Refine the Baseline Regression Models (120 mins):

TASK: Add higher order terms
TASK: Add interaction terms
TASK: Add regularization
TASK: Experiment to find the best performed model
