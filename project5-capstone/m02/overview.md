Data Wrangling Overview
By now, you have collected required bike-sharing data for further exploratory, visual, and predictive analysis tasks. However, some data may contain missing, misformatted and/or unexpected noises. Such sources of noise may downgrade the analysis performance significantly. Thus, you need to perform data wrangling before further analysing the data.

Data wrangling aims to remove the noise from data and convert the undesired data format to a format that is likely to be better for analysis.

You will be guided through the data wrangling process with the following instructional labs:

Lab: Data wrangling with stringr and regular expressions (Estimated time: 60 mins)

TASK: Standardize column names for all collected datasets
TASK: Remove undesired reference links using regular expressions
TASK: Extract numeric values using regular expressions
Lab: Data wrangling with dplyr (Estimated time: 60 mins)

TASK: Detect and handle missing values
TASK: Create indicator (dummy) variables for categorical variables
TASK: Normalize data
